# Project Title

Playwright Testing Tool developed by Microsoft for E2E and Unit Testing.

This template is designed to be used as a separate project, enabling QA teams to have their own repositories.

Suggestion: Access frontend using data-testid, BUT here is the example I implemented in SvelteKit on how to hide it in a production environment to protect against web scrapers, and DoS attacks.

Note: 
* Mocking data is not supported at this time and requires Vitest.
* You're required to have 1 GitHub Pages per account.

### Playwright Features Utilized
